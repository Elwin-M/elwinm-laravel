        As a seasoned Full-Stack Developer & DevOps Engineer at St. Maryâ€™s S.O.C. in Mississauga since January 2024,
        I've been instrumental in driving transformative changes within the organization's technological landscape.
        Leading the migration of outdated infrastructure to modern Nginx environments and spearheading the evolution of
        legacy PHP websites into scalable Laravel and Livewire projects are just a few examples of my proactive approach
        towards optimizing performance and enhancing security measures.
        Leveraging Docker for containerization and Kubernetes for deployment,
        I've streamlined processes, ensuring high availability and scalability.
        Moreover, my efforts in implementing an efficient email server solution have greatly enhanced internal communication and collaboration.
        Through collaborative troubleshooting and continuous optimization,
        I've consistently delivered solutions that not only meet but exceed stakeholder expectations,
        earning commendations for my role in improving system performance and user experience.
